    "-> The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design software systems in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions in a more intuitive and organized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The primary goals of OOP can be summarized Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Encapsulation: This helps in hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary interfaces, promoting information hiding and reducing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling real-world entities as objects with relevant characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass through a shared interface. "
