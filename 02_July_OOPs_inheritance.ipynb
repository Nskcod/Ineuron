    "\n",
    "Private Access Modifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Members declared as \"private\" are not accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "-> Private members are meant to be used within the class for internal implementation and should not be accessed directly from outside.\n",

    "-> They are indicated by a leading underscore (e.g., _protected_variable) as a naming convention.\n",
    "-> The protected access modifier is a way to indicate that a member is intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.\n",
